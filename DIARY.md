I had little chat with ChatGPT, and... looks like:

- it's good time for next "revolution" - AI time
- like in gold rush - in time like this guys who gets most are the one who create tools
- looks like I have quite unique / niche skills Rust + High Performance Computing => I could crete one of the best tools - I started looking into "domestic" soluiton => secure solution where everything could be run on local / personal / permises
- fisrt PoC looks good: ollama + goose + integration in python

Checked MGX - multi-agent solution where each has different role and they talk to each other as team. PoC: create team like Pinguines from Madagascar movies.

Kowalski is born.

Simple single agent based on Rust - talking to local ollama server.

First real neccessity: academic paper "translator" to process pdfs and  help quickly understand what is all about.
Works auite well.

Created "big vision" plan.
And start working on tooling - ie: how to ask outside world for more accurate data to process.

Fixing toolings and adding examples. The progression now flows more logically:

- First Blood (Basic functionality) ✓
- Tool Time (Core tools and integrations)
- Talk to me (CLI and document handling)
- Perform (Provider integrations and performance)
- Show must go on (Web interface and security)
- Nice to Have (Future improvements)
