# High Level Features

## Model Management & Integration

- Model performance metrics tracking (because we need more graphs to ignore)
- Model comparison tools (for when you can't decide which AI is less wrong)
- Support for multiple model providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic) (because vendor lock-in is so last year)
- Model fine-tuning interface (teach old AIs new tricks)
- Model caching system (because waiting for responses is like watching grass grow)

## Advanced Document Processing

- Support for more document formats (DOCX, EPUB, HTML) (because PDFs aren't frustrating enough)
- Image processing and OCR capabilities (let's make the AI squint at pictures)
- Markdown rendering and processing (because plain text is too mainstream)
- Table extraction and processing (Excel's worst nightmare)
- Academic paper specific processing:
    - Citation extraction and management
    - Figure and table extraction
    - LaTeX support (because some people enjoy pain)

## Conversation & Memory Management

- Long-term conversation storage (because AIs need therapy too)
-  Conversation search and indexing (find that one useful response among thousands of "I don't know"s)
- Conversation templates for specific tasks (because copy-pasting is hard)
- Export conversations to various formats (PDF, HTML, Markdown) (for posterity)
- Context window management (because memory isn't infinite, despite what Chrome thinks)

## Advanced Role System

- Role templates and custom role creation (play dress-up with your AI)
- Role chaining (make AIs argue with themselves)
- Role-specific memory and context (because personalities need baggage)
- Dynamic role switching based on context (AI with multiple personality featuresâ„¢)
- Role performance analytics (measure how well your AI plays pretend)

## User Interface & Interaction

- CLI interface with rich formatting (because GUIs are overrated)
- Web interface (for those who fear the terminal)
- REST API (because everything needs to be a service)
- WebSocket support for real-time interactions (because HTTP polling is so 2010)
- Interactive mode with command history (like a shell, but more pretentious)

## Integration & Automation

- Git integration (let AI review your code and judge your life choices)
- CI/CD pipeline integration (automate everything, break things faster)
- Slack/Discord/Teams integration (because AIs need social media too)
- Webhook support (for when you need to trigger AI existential crises automatically)
- Task automation and scheduling (let AI handle your boring tasks)

## Security & Privacy

- End-to-end encryption (because paranoia is a feature)
- Role-based access control (keep the AI on a need-to-know basis)
- Conversation anonymization (because even AIs deserve privacy)
- Audit logging (track who made the AI say what)
- Content filtering (keep the AI family-friendly)

## Analytics & Monitoring

- Usage statistics and analytics (because managers love graphs)
- Performance monitoring (watch your CPU cry in real-time)
- Cost tracking (monitor your AI's expensive habits)
- Response quality metrics (measure how often the AI is actually helpful)
- Error analytics and reporting (because someone needs to read those stack traces)

## Advanced Features

- Multi-language support (make the AI confused in multiple languages)
- Custom prompt templates (because writing prompts is an art form)
- Chain-of-thought visualization (watch the AI think it's thinking)
- Semantic search across conversations (find that needle in the AI haystack)
- Auto-summarization of long conversations (TL;DR as a service)

## Developer Tools

- Plugin system (because every project needs plugins nobody will use)
- Custom model training tools (teach AI your bad habits)
- Debug mode with detailed logging (see exactly where things went wrong)
- Testing utilities (pretend we write tests)
- Documentation generator (that nobody will read)
