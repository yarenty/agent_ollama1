# ROADMAP

## Phase 0:  First Blood

focus on managable but fully functional agent that could give obvious benefits: 
- [x] connecting to local ollama server
- [x] processing user request - respond in streaming manner
- [x] simple roles
- [x] Rust interface
- [x] initial release 


## Phase 1: Talk to me

> "Low-hanging fruit is still fruit, even if it's bruised." - A Pragmatic Gardener

Goals:
   - Set up basic architecture for future features
   - Focus on CLI and document support

Tasks:

- [ ] CLI Interface
   -  Rich formatting and interactive mode
   -  Command history and auto-completion
      ```rust
      // Example CLI structure
      kowalski chat "What's the meaning of life?"
      kowalski pdf analyze research-paper.pdf
      kowalski model list
      ```

- [ ] Document Format Support 
   - DOCX, Markdown, HTML support
   - Table extraction
 
- [ ] Conversation Management 
   - Search and indexing
   - Export to various formats


## Phase 2: Perform

> "Medium complexity is like a teenager - awkward but manageable." - A Patient Developer

Goals:
   - Improve existing functionality
   - Start working on provider integrations

Tasks: 

- [ ] Multiple Model Providers
   - OpenAI, Anthropic integration
   - Model switching
   ```rust 
   let openai = Provider::OpenAI::new(config);
   let anthropic = Provider::Anthropic::new(config);
   ```

- [ ] Advanced Role System 
   - Custom role creation
   - Role templates
   - Role chaining
   ```rust
   let custom_role = Role::builder()
       .with_personality("sarcastic")
       .with_expertise("rust")
       .build()?;
   ```

- [ ] Performance Monitoring
    - Response times
    - Token usage
    - Cost tracking
    ```rust
   agent.metrics.track_response_time(start, end);
   agent.metrics.log_token_usage(tokens_used);
   ```

## Phase 3: Show must go on

> "Complex features are like relationships - high maintenance but sometimes worth it." - A Wise Architect

Goals:
   - Set up web interface
   - Add basic security

Tasks:


- [ ] Web Interface
   - Basic dashboard
   - Real-time updates
   - Conversation management

- [ ] Integration APIs
   - REST API
   - WebSocket support
    -Webhook system

- [ ] Security Features
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Role-based access
   - Audit logging

## Phase 4:  Nice to Have (Future Considerations)

> "These features are like dessert - nice to have but not essential for survival." - A Feature Philosopher

Goals:
   - Maintain and improve existing features
   - Respond to user feedback

Tasks:


- [ ] Plugin System
- [ ] Advanced Analytics 
   ```rust
   agent.analytics.generate_quality_report()?;
   agent.analytics.export_usage_metrics()?;
   ```

- [ ] Auto-summarization
