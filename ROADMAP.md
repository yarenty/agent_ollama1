# ROADMAP

## Phase 0: First Blood

focus on managable but fully functional agent that could give obvious benefits: 
- [x] connecting to local ollama server
- [x] processing user request - respond in streaming manner
- [x] simple roles
- [x] Rust interface
- [x] initial release 

## Phase 1: Tool Time

> "The internet is like a library where all the books are scattered on the floor." - A Web Crawler

Goals:
   - Add internet browsing capabilities
   - Implement data collection and processing
   - Create a flexible tool system

Tasks:

- [ ] Web Browsing Tools
   - URL fetching and parsing
   - HTML content extraction
   - JavaScript rendering support
   ```rust
   let browser = WebBrowser::new(config);
   let content = browser.fetch("https://example.com").await?;
   let text = content.extract_main_content()?;
   ```

- [ ] Search Engine Integration
   - Google Search API
   - DuckDuckGo API
   - Custom search providers
   ```rust
   let search = SearchTool::new()
       .with_provider(Provider::Google)
       .with_api_key(key);
   let results = search.query("Rust programming").await?;
   ```

- [ ] Data Collection Tools
   - Web scraping with polite rate limiting
   - Data extraction patterns
   - Content summarization
   ```rust
   let scraper = WebScraper::new()
       .with_rate_limit(Duration::from_secs(1))
       .with_user_agent("Kowalski/1.0");
   
   let data = scraper.collect_data(urls, DataPattern::Article)?;
   ```

- [ ] Tool Management System
   - Tool registration and discovery
   - Tool chaining and pipelines
   - Result caching
   ```rust
   #[derive(Tool)]
   struct WebSearchTool {
       name: &'static str,
       description: &'static str,
       parameters: Vec<ToolParameter>,
   }
   
   let tool_chain = ToolChain::new()
       .add(WebSearchTool::new())
       .add(ContentExtractorTool::new())
       .add(SummarizerTool::new());
   ```

- [ ] Data Processing Pipeline
   - Content filtering
   - Metadata extraction
   - Format conversion
   ```rust
   let pipeline = DataPipeline::new()
       .filter(|content| content.is_relevant())
       .extract_metadata()
       .convert_to(Format::Markdown);
   ```

- [ ] Caching and Storage
   - Local cache for search results
   - Content versioning
   - Efficient storage strategies
   ```rust
   let cache = ToolCache::new()
       .with_ttl(Duration::from_hours(24))
       .with_storage(Storage::Local("./cache"));
   ```

## Phase 2: Talk to me

> "Low-hanging fruit is still fruit, even if it's bruised." - A Pragmatic Gardener

   - Set up basic architecture for future features
   - Focus on CLI and document support

Tasks:

- [ ] CLI Interface
   -  Rich formatting and interactive mode

      kowalski pdf analyze research-paper.pdf
      kowalski model list
      ```

- [ ] Document Format Support 
   - DOCX, Markdown, HTML support
   - Table extraction
 
- [ ] Conversation Management 
   - Search and indexing
   - Export to various formats

## Phase 3: Perform

> "Medium complexity is like a teenager - awkward but manageable." - A Patient Developer

Goals:
   - Improve existing functionality
   - Start working on provider integrations

Tasks: 

- [ ] Multiple Model Providers
   - OpenAI, Anthropic integration
   - Model switching
   ```rust 
   let openai = Provider::OpenAI::new(config);
   let anthropic = Provider::Anthropic::new(config);
   ```

- [ ] Advanced Role System 
   - Custom role creation
   - Role templates
   - Role chaining
   ```rust
   let custom_role = Role::builder()
       .with_personality("sarcastic")
       .with_expertise("rust")
       .build()?;
   ```

- [ ] Performance Monitoring
    - Response times
    - Token usage
    - Cost tracking
